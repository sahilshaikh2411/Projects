Amit Mehta	1	0	0	"Pathetic product. The brand has used a lot of clever advertising on TV for this product - bought it, poor plastic casing, bad blades, does not cut fine hair. The adjustment trimmer on top is really bad ... even on setting 3 it cuts very close ... and now the device does not charge. Works only when plugged into the socket else goes off.

Parimal	1	6	75	"The product per se is good and works well. However, the small shaft behind the removable blade part automatically got loose & is now broken. The machine is working but the shaft which takes power to blades is not there making this now useless.', ""Other issue was with battery. Had to charge it for 10 hours for about 25 mins back up & here too, the speed used to decrease after 10 mins use (which is say 2 times use) & hair is then plucked rather than being cut. This is very troublesome as one can't expect to keep charging for 10 hrs for 3 times use, especially while traveling."", ""So, before buying, do ensure about risk with blade shaft and battery. Those who still want to buy this, I would recommend to opt for wired trimmer which is not only cheaper but reliable as it runs directly on AC mains. Since I used to use this directly (without comb), it doesn't matter whether its 0.5 mm or 1 mm comb adjustment."	8	1	B00CE3FT66	Philips QT4005/15 Beard and Stubble Trimmer (M-Power Play)	1.0 out of 5 stars	Negetive	6 of 8 people found the following review helpful	08-12-2014

spreading the word	4	0	0	"The body build and design is jus too good for something within the 1k range. once fully charged its goes on for a week with no effort(10 mins every 2 days). only problem is my facial hair is curly hence i dont get an even trim when I'm using the adjustable head, they come out in patches. But once the head is removed u will get a proper trim. So if u want an adjustable trimming machine this is not the one for you. However if you are happy with the .5 mm trim(without the adjustable head) then this is a very good machine."	0	1	B00CE3FT66	Philips QT4005/15 Beard and Stubble Trimmer (M-Power Play)	4.0 out of 5 stars	Negetive		25-11-2013

That's a trade-off if you want the closest possible trim in the industry!"	0	1	B00CE3FT66	Philips QT4005/15 Beard and Stubble Trimmer (M-Power Play)	4.0 out of 5 stars	Negetive		05-11-2013

Dhruv	4	1	100	Great trimmer. Battery life lasts about 5-7 trims. I'ts great for removing body hair as well. Only issue is that there is no way to know exactly how much charge is left except keeping track of how many times you've used it which is not really dependable. But it's a great product for the price. No worries about scratches or cuts either.	1	1	B00CE3FT66	Philips QT4005/15 Beard and Stubble Trimmer (M-Power Play)	4.0 out of 5 stars	Negetive	1 of 1 people found the following review helpful	15-09-2015
Swapnil Hedaoo	4	1	100	I ordered this trimmer on Amazon and got it on 27/9/2014. Its a pretty good trimmer where you get 20 lock in length settings for your beard. I have used it quite a few times and it works well. The blades are also harmless and they give you a nice trim. As far as the charging time is concerned that should not be much of a problem as you hardly require 5 to 7 minutes for trimming; so you are not supposed to charge it for complete 10 hours as mentioned in the product information. The only issue with it is that it is really noisy but one can easily do away with it.	1	1	B00CE3FT66	Philips QT4005/15 Beard and Stubble Trimmer (M-Power Play)	4.0 out of 5 stars	Negetive	1 of 1 people found the following review helpful	18-10-2014

Om Arya	4	47	87.03703704	The trimmer is good but not recommended to shave pubic hair with this as I got cut with this trimmer and also battery works for 1hr after charging continuously for some hours. Comes pre charged out of the box and you get 1 yr additional guarantee if you register it on Philips site registration code is printed below the made in indonesia printed on the trimmer itself on the backside. Also I got this from jabong actually wanted to buy from here but price is too much here almost mrp rate. And it is water resistant as some water was splashed on the device itself in the bathroom while cleaning the blade and nothing happened to the device. Be sure to dry the appliance as I dried the device and cleaned the water off it thoroughly after cleaning the blade off the device the comb is also washable. And also the the device does not need to be oiled but they have not included the grease as it needs to be greased after some month that is not included. Don't know why but it is mentioned as it mentioned in the maintainance leaflet with pictures of some grease like thing being put on the backside of the blade where the shaft connects it. Also clean shave is not achievable with this trimmer as it gives finish of 1-3 day beard. Works while charging others have mentioned it does not which is lies although I wouldn't recommend it to use while charging as its a risk of damaging your device. Also no indicator of full charge. Only green light is there on charger glows when you keep it on charge and does not go off even when fully charged. So you have to to be carful as no indicator of full charge you have to make out charge on your own.. See picture 5 in photo for grease thingy.	54	1	B00CE3FT66	Philips QT4005/15 Beard and Stubble Trimmer (M-Power Play)	4.0 out of 5 stars	Negetive	47 of 54 people found the following review helpful	18-12-2014

Recharge it, use it as long on as it last-long (which on-paper is around 45mins). Its takes hardly 5-8mins for one shave. So, it can be used multiple times between recharge. although keeping it unused for long-time does drain some charge."", ""No, it doesn't give u a clean-shave. Its a trimmer not a razor. Have some mercy on your skin. The lowest setting is 0.5 mm which gives you the 5'oclock look i.e. just-barely-there shave.

We don't get to see them in shops now flooded with cheap Chinese gadgets. I came across this product on a mail received from Amazon and then I did not hesitate to try it out. Its a winner all the way and a must own item for all beard loving alpha males. For the price you pay it is a steal.Even if it lasts for month I have got my moneys worth.

msb	5	0	0	"A Valientine's Gift for my husband and he loved it! If you remove the outer plastic casing and use the trimmer directly, it gives a really neat, clean look. The purpose for which I wanted to buy this was, sometimes when my husband didnt get time to shave for a few days, it became very difficult to use the regular razor and he would need to go to a barber for his shave. Now, he can just use the trimmer! Also, while he's travelling, he can just use this in the morning instead of spending time doing a full shave. Very useful product. The quality of the device is excellent as can be expected from Philips. One great thing about it is the 110-240V support so you can use it anywhere in the world!"	0	1	B00CE3FT66	Philips QT4005/15 Beard and Stubble Trimmer (M-Power Play)	5.0 out of 5 stars	neutral		16-02-2015

Jatinder Kumar	4	0	0	I bought it last month & used for 6 times till now. Quality wise its ok wrt to price. Moreover operation wise its good. In india trimming changs are from rupees 20 to 80 for a single time in a saloon. Lets have and avarage of 30 therefore if it could work for 40 times its price is recovered moreover u need not to visit saloon. U cant say it rugged or best but its worth in this price with 2+1 years (conditional) warranty. Its prime function is to trim and it is doing it fine. Guys go for this economical option from philips. I dont mind if i need to throw it after 3 years there after i will have another with latest tech.	0	1	B00CE3FT66	Philips QT4005/15 Beard and Stubble Trimmer (M-Power Play)	4.0 out of 5 stars	Positive		13-09-2015

Venkata Pavan Katuru	5	0	0	It's a decent trimmer. If you want a clean shave remember that it's a damn trimmer. It won't give you a clean shave. The closest you can get to a shave is by removing the guard. It works great for those with pimples.  Also great to maintain a stubble.	0	1	B00CE3FT66	Philips QT4005/15 Beard and Stubble Trimmer (M-Power Play)	5.0 out of 5 stars	Positive		22-05-2015

The device is pretty neat in design and extremely easy to use. The fact that was surprising was - It ran for about 20 odd mins with the stock charge that it came with which was very impressive."", ""The calibrator comes with adjusting lengths from 0.5MM-10MM. Trust me that'll serve the purpose of a beard trim with ease. If you need more help on trimming patterns and how to go about it - suggest you to look up for a video in youtube. You can change the look completely depending on the occasion, very subtle i would say. No heating issues so far. Midl noise of the motor which is normal - Never clean the motor with water. Caution!"", '2 years warranty+1 added year, if you register the product on www.phillips.com.

Amazon Customer	4	0	0	I am resorting back to an electric shaver after three years. Back then I was not aware of wet shaving and dry shaving would hurt so I gave up my Philips dry shaver. Wet shaving with shaver is very smooth as the shaver just glides over the skin no cuts at all. To get a close shave I apply foam twice just like a barber does it at the saloon with two rounds of the shaver. The result is a good clean shave almost as good as a razor. The neck area may require a little clean up with the razor though. All in all a good shaver at the given price point and I doubt I will ever get back to using a razor again.	0	1	B00CE3FU06	Philips AquaTouch AT620/14 Men's Shaver	4.0 out of 5 stars	Negetive		21-01-2015

Ashish Sharma	4	0	0	"Before I bought this product, I knew electric shavers do not provide as close a shave as the 3+ blade razors by Gillette. They are rather recommended for the speedy shave every morning. I tried this product first time yesterday and well I struggled with speed. Maybe because I am amateur in using this. I had to do two rounds to make a decent shave out of this. I found the videos on the amazon page quite useful in showing how to use the product. It is also mentioned that it will take two to three weeks for my skin to get used to it which might reduce the irritation I felt after-shave. Hopefully 2-3 weeks will make it more handy to use and I can expect quick shave every morning. I found the pop-up trimmer quite useful. I think in the price point it is at, it is quite value-for-money product."	1	1	B00CE3FU06	Philips AquaTouch AT620/14 Men's Shaver	4.0 out of 5 stars	Negetive	0 of 1 people found the following review helpful	27-10-2013

It gives clean shave both dry and wet. Sometimes just by wetting the face with water or with foam or shaving cream or nothing at all. It gives the same smooth and clean shave. Takes 2 - 3 mins if shaved every alternate day, and no burning or itching issues . 1 full charge gives 20 - 25 mins of shave. Only the under chin area needs a redo. I am happy with its performance.

Sriharsha palanki	4	1	100	"A very good product. But we need to learn how to use it otherwise we will feel it is a waste and harmful product because when we use it for the first few times we get a little itching, dryness etc on our skin and cheek area. But if the itching, dryness and irritation persists then maybe your skin is not favourable to be shaved with an electronic shaver/trimmer. So get to know that before buying an electronic shaver/trimmer otherwise it will be a waste of money for you as you can't use it because of the skin irritation problem."	1	1	B00CE3FU06	Philips AquaTouch AT620/14 Men's Shaver	4.0 out of 5 stars	Negetive	1 of 1 people found the following review helpful	31-08-2015

S	4	2	66.66666667	Very good shaver. Been using it for  the past 7 months. Gives a very close shave. Have only used it dry. So cannot comment about wet shaving. It might take a few tries to 'learn' to get it right. Do note the blades are meant to shave not cut. So use the shaver for if you have a day or twos ( max 3 days) growth of stubble. If anything longer you ahve to first use the trimmer to cut it down to size and then use the shaver and trust me it comes out fine.  for all the negative comments - its probably because people are not using it right. I've used 3 different philips havers and they have all worked as intended.	3	1	B00CE3FU06	Philips AquaTouch AT620/14 Men's Shaver	4.0 out of 5 stars	Negetive	2 of 3 people found the following review helpful	02-08-2015

No cuts or burn and not even a single rash that came out after shaving with Gillette .There are some complain of irritation  about it. But needless to say I found nothing. Some says you need to be accustomed with it after using it for few days. But I did not find any difficulty and accustomed with it for the first use. The trimmer is average. About the battery, I would say with this price one could find such beautiful product. 10 hrs charging is enough for 30 min shaving..hey I don't think that a man need 30 min to shave. with this shaver I could shave whole my beard and moustache within 5 min (with foam).

Never had an experience of such a smooth shave. For better results afterwards don't miss a face wash with a soft soap and moisturizer to make it absolutely clean shave."", ""Update on 29-Jun-2015 After using this product for about 8 months, I would like to revise the review. The product is still in a good shape but it has lost the fineness. It claims to have a consistent performance for 2 years but that's not reality, I use it approximately 2-3 times a week and this is not giving me results as it did 8 months ago. You need to spend more time to get a fine and smooth shave now."	1	1	B00CE3FU06	Philips AquaTouch AT620/14 Men's Shaver	3.0 out of 5 stars	Positive	0 of 1 people found the following review helpful	10-11-2014

The 4Th blade that is used for tricky places is useless don't rely on it.

The design is super economical. I registered it online to get 1 year extended warranty in addition to 2 years company warranty. Blades are easy to clean and no worries of the shaver getting wet. Just let it dry overnight and then you are good to go. One of the most recommended shavers out there. Go for it without worrying, this one is a must have."	0	1	B00CE3FU06	Philips AquaTouch AT620/14 Men's Shaver	4.0 out of 5 stars	Positive		17-10-2015

Naba Kumar	4	0	0	"This is one of the good shavers out there. The ease of use is simply great, it can be tricky for first time users but nevertheless once you master it then it's worth every penny. You really need to go in circles when shaving for optimal performance, either circle your shaver or your hand but do circle it, this is the only correct way to use this shaver. The design is super ergonomical. I registered it online to get 1 year extended warranty in addition to 2 years company warranty. Blades are easy to clean and no worries of the shaver getting wet. Just let it dry overnight and then you are good to go. One of the most recommended shavers out there. Go for it without worrying, this one is a must have."	0	1	B00CE3FU06	Philips AquaTouch AT620/14 Men's Shaver	4.0 out of 5 stars	Positive		06-07-2014

Gaurav Bangera	4	0	0	The rating given by me is for the product but I feel the service can does have a lot of scope of improvement compared to the competition in the market. Tracking facilities should be better. Product is amazing and I guess guys wid facial hair need to have this necessarily.  Tried the dry shave n worked superbly.  Need to still do it with foam. Yes as mentioned by many others it may take time in the beginning and may develop aome rashes n red marks as it is a new way of shaving but initial hiccups are there in any new technology. I positively recommend this to guys but just a piece of advice for Amazon guys who need to bring in some good change in their tracking system. This product will definitely make people think smart n differently in terms of shaving. Hope Philips markets it well	1	1	B00CE3FU06	Philips AquaTouch AT620/14 Men's Shaver	4.0 out of 5 stars	Positive	0 of 1 people found the following review helpful	09-11-2014

Sachin Ghai	4	11	84.61538462	"I have been a long time user of electric razors primarily because my face is very sensitive. I would love the closeness of a razor blade and having the refreshing feeling you get from using shaving cream. But unfortunately shaving with a razor blade was a bloody mess for me . It didn't matter if I used the best razor blade system or whatever kind of shaving cream. I really had no other option than to use an electric razor and this worked fine for me.  After reading the overall good reviews for the Aquatouch, I figured I would give it a try even if I wasn't planning on using it with water and shaving cream. I was very pleased with how it shaved dry and would have been very satisfied if that's how I was going to use it. But one day I tried it with shaving cream....WOW!!! It worked great and the end result was getting a razor close shave. No nicks, no cuts, just close! After use, you just open up the lid and rinse out and let air dry. I also like the way the AT620 is whisper quiet. Not that it probably matters much, I used Edge shaving cream. I'm sure you could use pretty much any kind. I could not be happier with this electric razor. Now for our friends across the pond, I recommend to buy it...IT'S BLOODY AWESOME!!!"	13	1	B00CE3FU06	Philips AquaTouch AT620/14 Men's Shaver	4.0 out of 5 stars	Positive	11 of 13 people found the following review helpful	17-12-2014

Amazon Customer	5	0	0	"This is my first electric shaver, and I found this very reasonable and good. my skin became red when i used it first but no problems in subsequent uses. It has trimmer which works well. One thing to highlight is the three shave nobs are flexible and adjusts as per the shape of your jaw. This is not 100% waterproof as i found water going inside the battery chamber but it gets drained at bottom, so no problems as such. it also has a nice LED that turns green or yellow. i would recommend this to anyone."	0	1	B00CE3FU06	Philips AquaTouch AT620/14 Men's Shaver	5.0 out of 5 stars	Positive		02-04-2015

Aishwarya Mahajan	5	2	100	"Excellent Product. Did the great job. Hassle free Shaving. Can be used for both Dry and Wet Shave. Easy to clean, You can wash it under tap running water. You Might feel some itching after one or two shave, so it is suggestible to use Shaving foam for first two to three shaves as blades are very new and your skin might need some time to adjust with new razor. By far excellent product. You can get additional one year warranty by registering your product on Philips website. I got this for Rs 1765, which i think is a steal deal as original price of the product is Rs. 2995.

krish	5	40	85.10638298	"If you are looking for a easy, fast and comfortable shaver for close-cut, this is it. It also allows you to style your sideburns and mustache with the pop up trimmer.', 'SHAVING is excellent and very smooth with foam. Whoever is having irritation or rough shave, try applying some water if you are not using with foam. If you feel the shaving performance has degraded or becoming rough, clean the shaving blades, one at a time, following the manual.', ""POP UP Trimmer is good, you'll get used to it by time. Though i do not use it for mustache , it comes quite handy for grooming you sideburns after the shave."", ""BATTERY lasts for around 30-40 minutes on continuous usage. I charge it once or twice in a month as my usage is quite moderate. It should be adequate for a normal user. If you are planning on taking it with you on your vacation, just make sure you charge it fully. It takes around 8-10 to charge it fully, if its completely out of charge. It doesn't indicate whether its fully charged or not, though it shows low battery. This might matter to some people."", ""MAINTENANCE is quite easy on daily basis than other shavers. Just wash it under the tap, that's it. There's complete blade cleaning guide in the manual, which may help in keeping up the performance till last. you can do this , when you feel the performance is decreased."", ""Overall this is a amazing shaver at its price. If you are planning to buy either AT610 or AT620, you can go for AT620, If you need an integrated trimmer to your shaver. For me it's absolutely worth the extra 3,4hundred rupees over AT610."	47	1	B00CE3FU06	Philips AquaTouch AT620/14 Men's Shaver	5.0 out of 5 stars	Positive	40 of 47 people found the following review helpful	20-02-2014
